Goals
-Support 10,000 concurrent gRPC requests/sec
-Run across multiple data centers
-Ensure high availability and scalable performance


High-Level Architecture

client --> Global Load Balancer --> Regional Load Balancer (NGINX with gRPC support)-->  gRPC Service --> Message Queue   (Stores tasks temporarily — Kafka / Redis Streams)--> Worker Pool(Processes tasks and generates reports)-->Storage (Database with backup and replication)

Horizontal Scaling of gRPC Servers

-Run the gRPC service as Docker containers.
-containers are managed by Kubernetes – which helps with deployment, scaling, and recovery.
-Each container runs a stateless gRPC server – this means it doesn’t store any user-specific data between requests

How do we scale automatically?

Using HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) in Kubernetes.
-It monitors the load on each gRPC server.
-If servers are busy (high CPU/RAM or too many requests), it automatically adds more servers (pods).
-If traffic drops, it removes unnecessary servers to save cost.


gRPC Load Balancing

-NGINX with gRPC support
-Use gRPC round-robin / weighted load balancing for backend traffic.
-Global traffic handled by:Anycast IP (via BGP) for lowest-latency region routing


Report Storage & Persistence

-Use asynchronous processing: gRPC server pushes report generation tasks to a queue (e.g., Kafka / RabbitMQ / Redis Streams)
-Storage options
-Add caching layer (Redis) for frequent report fetches.

 Multi-Data Center Resilience

-Each data center operates independently but synchronizes via cross-region database replication and message broker mirroring (e.g., Kafka MirrorMaker).
-Ensure graceful degradation: if one DC fails, traffic reroutes to others automatically.
-Health checks + service mesh  for automatic failovers.

 Monitoring
-Collect metrics using Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
-Centralized logging with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd) stack

CI/CD & Deployment
-Define infrastructure as code using Terraform for reliable and repeatable setups.
-Use GitOps with tools like ArgoCD or Flux for version-controlled deployment.
